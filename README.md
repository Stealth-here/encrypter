Hello public 
This is a very simple code for encryption and decryption of audio files using two of the algoritms which are chaotic and chacha20
This comes with a simple UI as well which is used to establish a client server connection and initiate the transfer of files
To run the codes succesfully 
1. run python server_ui.py in a command prompt
2. run python reciever_ui.py in a different command prompt
make sure all the files in the repo are in the same directory
